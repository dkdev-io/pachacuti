# Pachacuti DevOps Session Report
**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Role**: DevOps Manager & CTO  
**Session Duration**: ~3 hours

## 🎯 Session Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Puppeteer Browser Automation Setup
- Installed Puppeteer in main `/Users/Danallovertheplace/pachacuti/` directory
- Created automated dashboard verification script
- Fixed inflated agent counts (34 → 3 realistic agents)
- Generated verification screenshots and reports

### 2. ✅ MCP Server Configuration Fix
- **Critical Issue Found**: Previous agent configured MCP servers in wrong location
- **Root Cause**: Servers were in `~/.claude.json` instead of Claude Desktop config

- **Status**: 
  - ✅ Figma MCP (with token)
  - ✅ Claude Flow & Ruv Swarm
