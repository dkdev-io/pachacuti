## Agent Verification System Implementation

### Work Accomplished
Implemented comprehensive Agent Verification System to prevent agents from claiming task completion without proof.

#### Core Components Created:
1. **Verification System** (`config/agent-verification-system.js`)
   - 4 verification levels: visual, tested, executed, confirmed
   - Confidence thresholds: 95% (certain) to 40% (uncertain)
   - Evidence validation and logging system
   - Communication filtering for false confidence claims

2. **Hook Scripts** (`scripts/agent-verification-hooks.sh`)
   - Pre-task verification setup
   - Post-task verification checks
   - Agent communication filtering
   - Confidence scoring and reporting

3. **Enhanced Agent Prompts** (`config/verification-enhanced-prompts.js`)
   - Modified prompts for all agent types
   - Forbidden confident phrases without evidence
   - Required uncertainty markers until verified
   - Evidence requirements for each agent type

4. **Installation System** (`scripts/install-verification-system.sh`)
   - Automated setup and configuration
   - CLI tool installation (`verify` command)
   - Hook integration with Claude Flow
   - Validation rules configuration

### Technical Decisions
- **Evidence-based verification**: Agents must show concrete proof (output, tests, files)
- **Confidence scoring**: 0-100% scale with reasoning requirements
- **Communication filtering**: Automatically converts confident claims to uncertain language
- **Hook integration**: Leverages Claude Flow hooks for seamless integration

### Testing Results
Successfully tested with sample coder agent:
- Agent created `src/addNumbers.js` function with documentation
- Created comprehensive test suite `tests/addNumbers.test.js`
- Function verified working with actual execution
- System correctly distinguishes between claims and evidence

### Key Features
- Prevents false completion claims
- Forces evidence-based reporting
- Tracks verification compliance
- Provides confidence scoring
- Filters overconfident communication

### Usage
```bash
# Check agent verification status
verify status [agent-id]

# Get confidence score
verify check [agent-id] [task-id]

# Test communication filter
verify filter "message" [agent-id]

# Generate verification report
verify report [agent-id]
```

### Problem Solved
Agents will no longer claim tasks are "completed", "finished", or "working" without providing:
1. Command output proving success
2. Test results showing passes
3. File contents demonstrating creation
4. Explicit user confirmation

This ensures reliability and trustworthiness in agent communications.
