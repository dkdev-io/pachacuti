## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/crypto-campaign-unified.git
cd crypto-campaign-unified

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import { CampaignManager } from './src/core/campaign.js'
import { generateAnalyticsReport } from './src/utils/analytics.js'

// Create campaign manager
const campaignManager = new CampaignManager()

// Create a new campaign
const campaign = campaignManager.createCampaign({
  name: 'Bitcoin Summer Campaign',
  type: 'display',
  budget: 10000,
  duration: 30
})

// Update campaign metrics
campaignManager.updateMetrics(campaign.id, {
  impressions: 50000,
  clicks: 2500,
  conversions: 125,
  spend: 5000
})

// Generate analytics report
const report = generateAnalyticsReport({
  impressions: 50000,
  clicks: 2500,
  conversions: 125,
  spend: 5000,
  revenue: 25000
})

console.log('Campaign ROI:', report.roas)
```
