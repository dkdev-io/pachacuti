# Test Coverage Analysis Guide

## Overview
This project uses Vitest with V8 coverage provider for comprehensive test coverage analysis and reporting.

## Coverage Configuration

### Thresholds
- **Global**: 90% lines, 90% functions, 85% branches, 90% statements
- **Core modules**: 95% for all metrics
- **Utilities**: 95% functions/lines, 90% branches

### Excluded Files
- `node_modules/`
- Test files (`src/test/`)
- Configuration files (`*.config.{js,ts}`)
- Build artifacts (`build/`, `dist/`, `coverage/`)
- Benchmark files (`*.bench.js`)

## Running Coverage Analysis

### Local Development
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode with coverage
npm run test:coverage:watch

# Coverage UI
npm run test:coverage:ui

# Generate HTML report
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/index.html
```

### CI/CD Integration
Coverage runs automatically on:
- All pushes to `main` and `develop`
- All pull requests
- Pre-commit hooks (with threshold enforcement)

## Coverage Reports

### Report Formats
1. **Console**: Real-time coverage summary
2. **HTML**: Interactive drill-down reports (`coverage/index.html`)
3. **JSON**: Machine-readable data (`coverage/coverage-summary.json`)
4. **LCOV**: Third-party tool integration (`coverage/lcov.info`)
5. **Clover**: XML format for CI/CD tools

### HTML Dashboard Features
- File-by-file coverage breakdown
- Line-by-line highlighting (covered/uncovered)
- Branch coverage visualization
- Function coverage analysis
- Interactive navigation

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Hooks
Automatically enforced before each commit:
- Run full test suite with coverage
- Enforce coverage thresholds
- Block commits that fail quality gates

### CI/CD Quality Gates
- Coverage threshold enforcement
- Performance benchmark validation
- Automated PR comments with coverage reports
- Trend analysis and historical tracking

## Coverage Metrics Analysis

### Current Status
```
All files          |   52.83 |    96.55 |      90 |   52.83 |
├── core/          |   50.34 |    96.55 |    90.9 |   50.34 |
└── utils/         |   56.61 |    96.55 |   88.88 |   56.61 |
```

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Benchmark files**: 0% coverage (excluded from metrics)
2. **Error handling paths**: Need additional edge case tests
3. **Integration scenarios**: Missing cross-module testing

### Improvement Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Achieve 90% line coverage
2. **Phase 2**: Improve branch coverage to 95%
3. **Phase 3**: Add integration tests
4. **Phase 4**: Performance regression testing

## Best Practices

### Writing Testable Code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Separate concerns (business logic vs. I/O)
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Avoid deeply nested conditionals

### Test Coverage Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Individual function/class testing
- **Integration tests**: Module interaction testing
- **Edge case testing**: Error conditions and boundaries
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark critical paths

### Coverage Maintenance
- Monitor coverage trends over time
- Address coverage gaps in code reviews
- Update tests when refactoring code
- Document complex test scenarios

## Tools and Integrations

### Local Tools
- **Vitest**: Test runner and coverage provider
- **V8**: Native JavaScript coverage engine
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality gates

### CI/CD Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing pipeline
- **Codecov**: Coverage trend analysis
- **Quality Gate**: Automated PR checks

### Monitoring
- Coverage badges in README
- Historical trend tracking
- Performance regression detection
- Automated quality reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Low coverage**: Add missing test cases
2. **Flaky tests**: Fix non-deterministic behavior
3. **Slow tests**: Optimize test execution
4. **Coverage gaps**: Identify untested code paths

### Performance Optimization
- Parallel test execution
- Selective coverage analysis
- Efficient test data setup
- Optimized CI/CD pipelines

### Coverage Analysis Tips
- Use `--coverage.skipFull` to hide 100% covered files
- Check branch coverage for complex conditionals
- Review uncovered lines in HTML reports
- Focus on critical business logic first

## Maintenance Commands

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
npm run test:coverage -- --reporter=verbose

# Coverage with specific thresholds
npm run test:coverage -- --coverage.thresholds.lines=95

# Coverage for specific files
npm run test:coverage -- src/core/

# Performance benchmarks
npm run bench:run
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
npx pre-commit install

# Run quality gates manually
npx pre-commit run --all-files

# Check coverage trends
cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | jq '.total'
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Mutation testing**: Code quality validation
2. **Visual regression testing**: UI component coverage
3. **API contract testing**: Integration validation
4. **Security testing**: Vulnerability scanning

### Advanced Analytics
- Coverage trend analysis
- Test effectiveness metrics
- Performance regression detection
- Quality score calculation
